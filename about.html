				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I am a senior at the University of Kentucky majoring in Information Communication Technology and minoring in History. Throughout college I have worked in several ICT-related positions, including electronics repair at Device Pitstop and helpdesk- and systems administration-related work at Compu-Tech Solutions, both here in Lexington, KY.</p>
				<p>In my spare time, I enjoy messing with my personal gaming rig and server, as well as playing with the various cats and dogs in my life.</p>
				<p>Feel free to peruse my <a href="Media/Resume.pdf">Resume</a> or my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-carpenter-78a80b16b/">LinkedIn profile</a> if you'd like to know more about my professional experience, or my <a href="photos.html">Media page</a> if you'd like a glimpse at some of my work (or cute animals)!</p>
